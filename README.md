## Description

This repository documents my progress through the 100DaysOfCode challenge, where I will be working on various Python projects to enhance my coding skills.

These projects are part of the Udemy Course -
[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

Some projects may look like they have multiple copies, however it's just that sometimes I created my own code while also making the project following the course. Also, some days use a separate tool for projects and so I have skipped those codes in this repository.
