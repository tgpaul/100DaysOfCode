## Description

This repository documents my progress through the 100DaysOfCode challenge, where I will be working on various Python projects to enhance my coding skills.

These projects are part of the Udemy Course -
[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

Some projects may look like they have multiple copies, however it's just that sometimes I created my own code while also making the project following the course. Also, some days use a separate tool for projects and so I have skipped those codes in this repository.


## Daily Projects Description: -

### I. Beginner: -

#### 1. Band Name Generator

- **File:** [band_name_gen.py](Daily%20Projects/Beginner/band_name_gen.py)
- **Description:** A simple Python script that generates band name suggestions based on user input. üéº
  
#### 2. Tip Calculator
- **File:** [tip_calculator.py](Daily%20Projects/Beginner/tip_calculator.py)
- **Description:** A simple Python script that takes a bill amount as user input and then outputs the bill split. üí∏

#### 3. Treasure Island
- **File:** [treasure_island_game.py](Daily%20Projects/Beginner/treasure_island_game.py)
- **Description:** A simple game that depicts the use of control statements. The game changes according to the user's inputs. üèùÔ∏è

#### 4. Rock Papper Scissor
- **File:** [rock_paper_scissors.py](Daily%20Projects/Beginner/rock_paper_scissors.py)
- **Description:** A simple rock-papper-scissor game. ‚úÇÔ∏è

#### 5. Random Password Generator
- **File:** [random_password_generator.py](Daily%20Projects/Beginner/random_password_generator.py)

## How to Use

You can navigate through the folders to explore each day's project and the exercises. The projects are organized by difficulty level, making it easy to follow my coding journey from beginner to more advanced concepts.

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference, or even contribute to the projects if you have ideas for improvement!
