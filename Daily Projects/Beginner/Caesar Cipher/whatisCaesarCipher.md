# What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher, named after _Julius Caesar_ who is believed to have used it, is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It falls under the category of substitution ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For instance, with a _shift_ of 3, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. This shift value is known as the "key."

_Caesar ciphers_ are easily cracked through brute force, given the limited number of possible keys (25 in English). Despite its lack of security in modern times, the _Caesar cipher_ holds historical significance. _Julius Caesar_ is said to have used this technique to encrypt his military messages, though with a higher shift value for enhanced security. It's an elementary example of encryption and decryption principles, paving the way for more complex cryptographic methods that are crucial in contemporary digital communication security.
