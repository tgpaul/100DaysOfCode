# Hangman Game Rules and Steps

Hangman is a word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter.

## Here's how the game works:

1. The computer will provide you with a random word and marks the spaces for each letter with underscores (\_), representing the length of the word.
2. You have to start guessing letters that you think might be in the word.
3. For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s) in the word.
4. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn on the gallows (i.e, you lose a life).
5. The game continues until you successfully guesses the word or the "hangman" figure is completed (i.e, you have lost all the lives).

Hangman is a fun and interactive word game that combines strategy and deduction. It's a great way to challenge your vocabulary and critical thinking skills.

Enjoy playing Hangman!

**Note for me:**

- Add the gallows
- Add the feature to show all the letter guesses the users already made, and if he/she guesses that letter again then print the appropriate message.
